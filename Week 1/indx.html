			I was raised in Chardon but currently live in Chesterland, Ohio with my 
			fiance and our kids. 
			<br>
			I currently work at a company called Dolbey Systems Inc.
			providing technical support for customers
			<br>
			using our CAC software and dictation
			software.

			Some things about me are that I am 1/4 Japanese, and can not speak a lick
			<br>
			of it.
			Also my second love is too cook.
		    The reason I am taking this class, besides for the degree, is 
			<br>
			because I have always wanted to become better at web development
			and it is exciting to get to learn
			<br>
			what goes behind the scenes of more advanced and scripted sites.
