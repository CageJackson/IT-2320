				I was raised in Chardon but currently live in Chesterland, Ohio with my 
				fiance and our kids. 
				<br>
				I currently work at a company called Dolbey Systems Inc.
				providing technical support for customers
				<br>
				using our CAC software and dictation
				software.

				Some things about me are that I am 1/4 Japanese, and can not speak a lick
				<br>
				of it.
				Also my second love is too cook.
				The reason I am taking this class, besides for the degree, is 
				<br>
				because I have always wanted to become better at web development
				and it is exciting to get to learn
				<br>
				what goes behind the scenes of more advanced and scripted sites.
